## Introduction 📝

In **Bangladesh**, rural farmers often face **electricity shortages** that affect agricultural productivity. At the same time, reliance on **fossil-fuel-powered irrigation** creates environmental challenges and puts pressure on the **national electricity grid**.  

**Farmonergy** is designed as a **hardware-software integrated solution** that:

- Enables **farmers** to generate and monitor solar energy  
- Uses **IoT sensors, batteries, and smart devices** for real-time monitoring  
- Allows **automatic surplus electricity transfer** to the national grid  
- Supports **financial sustainability** through loans and government incentives  
- Provides **predictive maintenance** and operational transparency  

> With Farmonergy, rural agriculture can become **self-sufficient, sustainable, and profitable**, while contributing to **clean energy adoption** in Bangladesh.

## 1. Project Overview 🏞️

**Farmonergy** is a **smart, integrated solar farm platform** connecting four types of stakeholders:

- **Farmers** – produce energy, monitor usage, earn income  
- **Government Authorities** – monitor systems, regulate policies, track energy goals  
- **Operators** – install, maintain, and repair solar systems  
- **Financial Organizations** – provide loans, track repayments, generate financial reports  

It combines **IoT hardware** and **feature-driven software** to improve **agricultural productivity**, reduce **CO₂ emissions**, and support **energy self-sufficiency**.  

---

## 2. Problems Addressed ⚠️

- Rural areas face **frequent power outages**  
- Heavy reliance on **fossil fuels** for irrigation → environmental damage  
- Pressure on the **national electricity grid**  
- Farmers often **cannot afford solar installations**  
- Lack of **real-time monitoring & predictive maintenance**  

---

## 3. System Goals 🎯

1. Real-time **solar energy monitoring**  
2. Automatic **grid sharing** for income  
3. Financial support via **loans & subsidies**  
4. **Predictive maintenance** for system health  
5. Government oversight & **transparency**  
6. Reduce **CO₂ emissions**  
7. Promote **energy self-sufficiency** in rural agriculture
